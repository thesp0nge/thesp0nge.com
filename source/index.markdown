<span class="capital">H</span>i and welcome to [Kitchen](http://thesp0nge.com),
my website about application security, hacking and life.

<span class="capital">M</span>y name is Paolo and this is my personal website where you can find recipes
about application security, penetration testing, code reviewing, smart coding
and project management tips such as BDD and TDD applied to the tool I'm writing
and much more.

<span class="capital">M</span>ost of the tech content will be published in English, instead posts in Italian
will be about personal stuff and simple life stories.

<span class="capital">I</span>f you want to read more about me, go ahead to
[this](http://about.me/thesp0nge) page or just start reading the
[blog](http://thesp0nge.com/blog).

Have fun.
