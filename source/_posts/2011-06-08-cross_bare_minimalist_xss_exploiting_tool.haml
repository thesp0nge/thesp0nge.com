  Ruby is a lovely programming language, really. It has plenty of awesome libs,
  called gems in rubyish slang, written from brilliant hackers all of the
  world.
  %br
  One of the most valuable example is 
  %a{:href=>'http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/mechanize'}
    mechanize
  , written by 
  %a{:href=>'https://github.com/tenderlove'}
    tenderlove.
%p
  mechanize is written to automate interaction between ruby scripts (eventually
  rails applications) and existing website. In example, you may want to single
  sign-on to your 
  %a{:href=>'http://flickr.com'}
    flickr.com
  account and grab some information... let's say you want to grab the number of
  your connections.
  %br
  With mechanize you can automate this in a piece of ruby code.
%p
  I was wondering with a friend some months ago on how to leverage the false
  positive numbers in penetration test scanners. I was aware about mechanize
  and I pointed out that using xpath query, after the canary was injected, we
  can check out if the resulting piece of javascript is correctly placed in the
  DOM of the page and thus it has been executable or if it has sanitized or
  even placed in a comment.
%p
  To make some tests I started a small project I called 
  %a{:href=>'https://github.com/thesp0nge/cross'}
    cross.
%p
  Project scope is to create a tool that takes an url, honors the sitemap.xml
  file, eventually fuzz the site using
  %a{:href=>'https://github.com/thesp0nge/enchant'}
    enchant
  and performing injection with xss canaries checking out the resulting web
  page.
%p
  Using xpath I'm going to check where the canary is placed within the page,
  trying to leverage false positives.
  %br
  I'm not sure at the moment if I'm going to write a full featured tool for
  pentester of a little tool for developers just to test apps in a quick and
  dirty manner before rolling them out.
