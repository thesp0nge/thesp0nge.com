Yesterday I announced on my blog that I would spice the #appsec world with a
biggest project than a sast tool, that actually it's *hard* to build.

By creating small tools testing web applications from different perspectives,
it's easier to me creating a full featured #application security tool for codesake.com

However I must sit down and write some note about architecture and appsec
tasks I want to solve with codesake and for such a reason a good plain and
dedicated moleskine is the solution.

And a lot of post here, of course...
