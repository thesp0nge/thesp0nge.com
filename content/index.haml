//  I love http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/hero.html layout. That's
//  why I'm going to have a fixed "Welcome" box in the homepage and up to
//  featured_count articles horizontally aligned.
//  That's why I think I'm going to hack a bit sorted_article array in order to
//  take not the blog posts but articles instead.
