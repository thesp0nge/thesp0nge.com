## What's this website?

thesp0nge.com is [my](http://about.me/thesp0nge) personal website.
It's a place where I share thoughts about application security, hacking, ruby
on rails, taekwondo, gtd, bdd, testing and other stuff I find fun to share.

I'm in love with static website generator since I do believe that a full LAMP
installation is simply too much for a blog... everything you need is an HTML
page and some Javascript to connect with full featured service providers such
as disqus for comments, facebook or digg for sharing and so on.

I started with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) two years ago and
then moved to nanoc since I found it more appealing. After a major rewrite of
my blog layout using nanoc and twitter
[bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstap) CSS framework I met
[octopress](http://octopress.org) and it's love.
